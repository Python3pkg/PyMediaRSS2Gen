How To Contribute
=================

Every open source project lives from the generous help by contributors that sacrifice their time and PyMediaRSS2Gen is no different.


- No contribution is too small; please submit as many fixes for typos and grammar bloopers as you can!
- If you have any questions, feel free to ask them as an [issue](https://github.com/wedi/PyMediaRSS2Gen/issues/).


To make participation as pleasant as possible, this project adheres to the [Code of Conduct](http://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/) by the Python Software Foundation.


Bugs
----

When [reporting bugs](ihttps://github.com/wedi/PyMediaRSS2Gen/issues/), please include example code that reproduces the issue. The best reproductions are self-contained scripts that pull in as few dependencies as possible. An entire Django stack is harder to handle.

Let us know:
- What did you do?
- What did you expect to happen?
- What actually happened?
- What versions of PyMediaRSS2Gen and Python are you using?
