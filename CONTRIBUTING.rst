How To Contribute
=================

Every open source project lives from the generous help by contributors
that sacrifice their time and PyMediaRSS2Gen is no different.

This project lives on `GitHub`_. You are very welcome to fork this
project and submit pull requests! If you donâ€™t know how to do this you
can still report errors by `opening an issue`_.


*By contributing your code, you agree to license your contribution under
the MIT license.*


To make participation as pleasant as possible, this project adheres to
the `Code of Conduct`_ by the Python Software Foundation.


Here are a few hints and rules to get you started:

-  No contribution is too small; please submit as many fixes for typos
   and grammar bloopers as you can!

-  Add yourself to the `AUTHORS.rst`_ file in an alphabetical fashion.
   Every contribution is valuable and shall be credited.

-  If your change is noteworthy, add an entry to the `CHANGELOG.rst`_
   file, add the issue number if applicable.

-  Right now PyMediaRSS2Gen is considered ALPHA. Breaking backwards
   compatibility is possible but should still be avoided.


And as for all (Python) projects:

-  Obey `PEP 8`_ and `PEP 257`_.

-  Write `good commit messages`_.

-  Ideally, `squash`_ your commits, i.e. make your pull requests just
   one commit.
